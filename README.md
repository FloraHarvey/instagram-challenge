Instagram Challenge
===================

Task
-----

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

## User stories

MVP:

```
As a user
So I can show my friends the cool things I've done
I want to be able to post pictures

As a user
So I can see what my friends are up to
I would like to see a stream of their photos

As a user
So I can let my friends know what I think
I want to be able to leave comments on pictures

As a user
So I can see how popular my pictures are
I would like other users to be able to like them
```

Version 2

```
As a user
So I can control what is posted to my page
I would like to sign in and out

As a user
So the stats aren't skewed
I want people to only be able to like a photo once

As a user
So people can see all my photos in one place
I would like a profile page with clickable thumbnail photos

As a system maintainer
So I can monitor what the site is being used for
I want only registered users to be able to post photos/comments
```

Version 3

```
As a user
For convenience
I would like to be able to sign in with Facebook

As a user
So I can make my photos look better
I want to be able to add filters

As a user
To enhance my experience
I would like the website to look good
```
